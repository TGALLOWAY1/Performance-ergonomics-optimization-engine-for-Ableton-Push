The Performability Engine is an ergonomics-driven optimization system for performing electronic music on the Ableton Push.

It analyzes MIDI performances, evaluates the physical difficulty of pad layouts, and uses a modular cost engine (movement, simultaneity, gesture naturalness, cognitive grouping, and muscle-memory stability) to recommend musician-adaptive remappings.

The project includes a Drum Rack Remapping Workbench, a visual interface for:
- Previewing and editing layouts
- Drag-and-drop remapping of samples
- Automatically regenerating performance MIDI
- Viewing playability analytics (heatmaps, gesture timelines, transition graphs)
- Running controlled “performability test scenarios” to validate ergonomics models

This repo showcases:
- Applied optimization algorithms
- Interactive UI/UX for complex data
- MIDI parsing & transformation
- Human-centric ergonomics modeling
- Music performance engineering
- Future extensions into ML preference learning and real-time adaptive layouts
